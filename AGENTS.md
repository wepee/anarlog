# Overview

For BlackMushi work, read and follow [.agents/skills/anarlog-workflow/SKILL.md](.agents/skills/anarlog-workflow/SKILL.md). Start requested work immediately; record useful decisions and non-obvious lessons in Linear, not routine execution logs.

BlackMushi is a pnpm and Rust workspace. Read the nearest `AGENTS.md` before changing a component.

- `apps/desktop/`: Tauri 2 with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind. Zustand owns UI state; TanStack Query/Form own queries, mutations, and forms.
- `apps/web/`: React with TanStack Start/Router, Vite, and Tailwind; deployed through Vercel.
- `apps/mobile/` and `apps/watch/apple/`: Expo/React Native with a Rust UniFFI bridge, plus a native watchOS app. Use the versions in `apps/mobile/package.json` and the mobile instructions.
- `apps/api/`: Rust/Axum API. `apps/stripe/`: Bun/Hono webhook and seat-worker component packaged with the Rust billing API. Deploy both through `api_cd.yaml` with `service=billing`.
- `apps/cli/`: Rust CLI/TUI and MCP entry point (`anarlog-cli` package, `anarlog` binary).
- `crates/db-app/`: canonical SQLite schema and migrations shared by desktop and mobile. `db-core` owns runtime initialization, `db-migrate` owns migration execution, and `plugins/db/` / `crates/mobile-bridge/` expose transports. React consumes these through `packages/db-runtime`, `packages/db-react`, and `packages/db-tauri`; `packages/db` is the Drizzle adapter.
- `enterprise/`: a separate Cargo workspace with a commercial license. Community packages must not depend on it.

Sessions are the core entity: all notes are backed by sessions. ProseMirror powers the editor (`packages/editor`, via `@handlewithcare/react-prosemirror`); documents use TipTap-dialect ProseMirror JSON, with converters/validation in `crates/tiptap`.

## Commands

- Install: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. Match CI's Node 22, `package.json#packageManager`, and `rust-toolchain.toml`; keep lockfiles in sync with intentional dependency changes.
- Format: `pnpm exec dprint fmt --allow-no-files <changed-files>`; check: `pnpm exec dprint check --allow-no-files <changed-files>`. Whole-repository check: `pnpm fmt:check`.
- Typecheck (TS): `pnpm -F <package-name> typecheck`; use `pnpm -r typecheck` for changes spanning packages. Use actual names from package manifests, such as `@anlg/desktop`.
- Typecheck (Rust): `cargo check --locked -p <package>`; match the relevant workflow's features and target. A root `cargo check` does not cover the separate enterprise workspace or every platform.
- Build shared UI before desktop/web checks: `pnpm -F @anlg/ui build`.
- Desktop dev: `pnpm exec turbo dev:desktop`.
- Desktop release on macOS: `pnpm -F @anlg/desktop tauri:build:macos`, which wraps `scripts/build-macos.sh`. Xcode 26+ ships a SwiftPM build system that internalizes `@_cdecl` symbols in release, which breaks `swift-rs` linking; that script pins `DEVELOPER_DIR` to the Command Line Tools toolchain. A plain `tauri build` fails at link time with undefined SwiftRs symbols. The script also signs the bundle: with a Developer ID when one is available (`APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` or the keychain), ad-hoc otherwise, because the linker's own signature carries no entitlements and leaves TCC keying the app on a cdhash that changes on every build. It stamps `release-version.json` (or `APP_VERSION`) into `tauri.conf.json` for the build and restores the file afterwards; without that the bundle inherits the desktop crate's `0.0.0` and the updater offers every published release as an upgrade. `scripts/build-macos.sh --sign-only <path to .app>` re-signs an existing bundle without rebuilding.
- Web dev: `pnpm exec turbo dev:web`.

## Pre-commit verification

Treat `.github/workflows/` and their composite actions as the source of truth for commands, setup, features, targets, and exclusions. Re-read them when changing this guide or CI. Run locally reproducible checks before committing; include affected consumers of shared packages even when workflow path filters miss them. A skipped workflow/job is not passing coverage.

### Common checks

- Format the changed files, then check the same files. `fmt.yaml` checks added/copied/modified/renamed files against the PR base and falls back to `pnpm fmt:check` when no base is available. Use the complete branch diff for final verification, not only the last commit. Respect `dprint.json` associations/exclusions: `--allow-no-files` permits excluded paths but does not validate them. Avoid formatting unrelated work in a shared workspace.
- `lint.yaml`: `pnpm exec oxlint --quiet --format=github apps/desktop/src/`. The root `pnpm lint` also runs type-aware Oxlint and ESLint; it is broader than this CI job. Run configured ESLint checks for touched desktop/web query code with `pnpm exec eslint <changed-files>`.
- `ci.yaml`: run both license-boundary Python commands and the complete `node --test` command listed there. These run on every PR, including documentation-only changes.
- `zizmor.yaml` runs on every PR. Reproduce `uvx zizmor --format sarif .` (save output outside the repository) with read-only GitHub access; report unavailable authenticated checks. Inspect the SARIF findings: a successful scan/upload does not mean zero findings. Fix findings introduced by workflow/action changes and report existing findings separately.
- For TypeScript changes, run affected packages' typechecks and existing test scripts. For Rust changes, run affected crate checks/tests with the workflow's flags; retain `--locked`, feature selections, test filters, and Clippy's `-D warnings`. Add regression coverage for changed behavior, especially persistence, auth, billing, and recording lifecycles.

### Checks by component

This map is a starting point; execute the relevant workflow's full locally reproducible job, including setup and generated-file checks.

| Changed component                                         | Validation and source                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Desktop frontend and shared UI/editor packages            | Build `@anlg/ui`, then `pnpm -F @anlg/desktop typecheck`, `pnpm -F @anlg/desktop test`, lint, and i18n validation. Run changed packages' own scripts too. See `desktop_ci.yaml`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Desktop Rust, plugins, CloudSync                          | See `desktop_ci.yaml`: macOS checks both `direct-distribution` and `app-store` features and runs desktop/workspace tests; Linux/Windows use their own targets and test selections. Preserve the workspace-test exclusions. CloudSync gates include `cargo test --locked -p cloudsync` and `cargo test --locked -p db-core 'cloudsync::' -- --test-threads=1`. Swift window changes also require `swift build --package-path plugins/windows/swift-lib` on macOS. |
| Web and its shared packages                               | Build `@anlg/ui`; run typecheck and test for both `@anlg/supabase` and `@anlg/web`, then `pnpm -F @anlg/web media:figures:check`. See `web_ci.yaml`. Routing, SSR, content-generation, dependency, and bundling changes also need `pnpm -F @anlg/web build` with the build environment from `web_cd.yaml`.                                                                                                                                                       |
| API and related crates                                    | See `api_ci.yaml`: `cargo check -p api`; tests for `api-cloud`, `api-auth`, `mcp`, `supabase-auth --features server`, `api-sync`, `transcribe-proxy --lib`, the API drain test, and the deployment/E2EE Python tests. Regenerate and verify OpenAPI as described below.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| CLI, agent access, local SQLite schema/migrations, TipTap | See `cli_ci.yaml`: locked tests for `agent-access`, `anarlog-cli`, `db-app`, `db-core`, `db-migrate`, and `tiptap`; Clippy with `--all-targets --no-deps -- -D warnings`; release CLI build and isolated smoke tests. Preserve the Linux/Windows smoke checks and skill/docs validation.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Mobile, watch, and native bridge                          | `pnpm -F @anlg/mobile typecheck` and `pnpm -F @anlg/mobile test`. See `mobile_ci.yaml` for `APP_VARIANT=stable`, bridge builds (`cargo xtask mobile-bridge ios` / `android`), iOS Release, Android `assembleRelease`, and watchOS simulator builds.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Stripe billing service                                    | Run `pnpm -F @anlg/stripe typecheck` and `pnpm -F @anlg/stripe test` (requires Bun). `stripe_ci.yaml` runs the billing component checks; `api_cd.yaml` with `service=billing` deploys the combined service. Dependency/container changes also require a local image build using the repository root as context: `docker build --target billing-runtime -f apps/api/Dockerfile .`.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Enterprise capture                                        | Use `--manifest-path enterprise/Cargo.toml`; the root workspace does not include these checks. Run the reliability/fixture-replay, worker library, control-plane upgrade, and Clippy commands in `enterprise_ci.yaml`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### Generated files and data compatibility

- Desktop i18n has its own `desktop_ci.yaml` job. When translated copy, extraction, or catalogs change, run `pnpm -F @anlg/desktop exec lingui extract --clean --workers 1` and `pnpm -F @anlg/desktop exec lingui compile --strict --workers 1`; include the resulting `apps/desktop/src/i18n/locales` changes and rerun until stable. `pnpm -F @anlg/desktop i18n:check` includes a diff against HEAD, so an intentional uncommitted catalog change will fail that final diff. Run it when catalogs are committed/clean; do not discard intended translations to make it pass.
- API contract changes: run `cargo test -p api gen_openapi_json`, then `pnpm -F @anlg/api-client openapi` when the contract changes. Commit `apps/api/openapi.gen.json` and corresponding generated client changes. CI checks the OpenAPI file against HEAD; verify generation is stable before committing and the diff is clean afterward.
- Regenerate native bindings and permissions using their owning Rust build/generator; do not hand-edit generated output. The macOS desktop job checks `plugins/db/js/bindings.gen.ts`, `plugins/db/permissions/autogenerated`, and `plugins/db/permissions/schemas/schema.json` for drift. Mobile bridge generation belongs to `cargo xtask mobile-bridge`.
- Keep shipped SQLite migration IDs/SQL append-only, maintain desktop/mobile schema parity, and update the Drizzle adapter when schema changes affect it. Follow `crates/db-app/AGENTS.md` for explicit CloudSync migration scope and table policy. Test upgrades from supported older schemas as well as fresh initialization.

Fix failures caused by the change before committing. If an existing unrelated failure or unavailable platform, secrets, hardware, or infrastructure prevents a check, record the exact command, result, and reason in the handoff. Keep focused passes separate from full-suite failures; do not report full validation or release readiness with unresolved gates.

## Release verification

- For an explicitly requested stable desktop release, follow `.agents/skills/release-new-version/SKILL.md` and inspect the current workflows. The explicit version must have an accurate, validated changelog merged into `main`; record that exact candidate SHA.
- Before freezing each release candidate, complete the release skill's surface review: check product changes against CLI, local and hosted MCP, API/generated clients, agent skills/plugins, and documentation. Merge required updates and verify their publication through each surface's own channel. Record reasons for unchanged surfaces and explicit deferrals; a desktop build or changelog alone does not prove these surfaces are current.
- Desktop native CI (macOS, Windows, Linux x86_64/ARM64, and Swift) runs only on the daily schedule and `workflow_dispatch`, including release-candidate verification. PRs and pushes to `main` run desktop JS and i18n checks. Mobile iOS, Android, and watchOS native jobs also skip PRs. Check each required job and SHA, not only the aggregate green result.
- Follow the release skill's candidate `desktop_ci.yaml` dispatch: CloudSync source rebuilds run on `workflow_dispatch` or the Nightly caller with `rebuild_cloudsync=true`. Verify the platform artifacts and tests from that candidate before approving the desktop lanes. Mobile has its own native-build and release requirements.
- `desktop_cd.yaml` builds a stable draft and records artifact provenance; `desktop_publish.yaml` publishes those verified artifacts using the explicit version, candidate SHA, and dry-run ID. Require a successful first-attempt dry run, matching hashes, and a candidate merged into `main`. Dispatch from the tested immutable Nightly tag so the workflow SHA still equals the candidate. Dispatch a fresh build after failure; do not mix evidence across rerun attempts or commits.
- Verify publish completion, immutable `desktop_v<version>` tag, GitHub/CrabNebula assets, signatures/hashes, and downstream store/package results. Report pending store submission or package-publication work separately.
- Web, API, and hosted database have separate `*_cd.yaml` workflows; the billing API and Stripe component share the API billing deployment. Check the relevant packaging/build path before deployment; filtered Docker builds must include every workspace dependency's manifest and source. Verify the deployed version/health and affected behavior after the workflow succeeds.
- Release and optional QA are separate requested workflows. Run the QA skills or hardware/provider E2E workflows when explicitly requested; do not add them as implicit publish gates. Report build, QA, publication, and live deployment results separately.

## Guidelines

- JavaScript/TypeScript formatting runs through `oxfmt` via dprint's exec plugin.
- Use `useForm` (tanstack-form) and `useQuery`/`useMutation` (tanstack-query) for form/mutation state. Avoid manual state management (e.g. `setError`).
- Keep schema creation, migrations, and DB initialization on the Rust side. TypeScript consumes the shared transport contracts; the Drizzle adapter uses `executeProxy` and must not parse SQL or remap named rows into positional rows.
- New SQLite migrations must be downgrade-safe (older builds tolerate newer schemas): additive only, new columns nullable or with a DEFAULT. If a migration can't be downgrade-safe, add a `-- breaking` line to the leading comment block of its `.sql` file so older builds refuse the database with an update prompt. Nightly and stable desktop builds share one database, so a breaking migration published in Nightly locks stable out until stable ships it.
- Branch naming: `fix/`, `chore/`, `refactor/` prefixes.
- PR titles and commit messages: the title summarizes intent, not the diff or a ticket number. The description is a short summary of what changed, not a generated commit log or file-by-file recap. See `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` for the human-facing Intent/Demo structure.

## Code Style

- Avoid creating types/interfaces unless shared. Inline function props.
- Do not write comments unless code is non-obvious. Comments should explain "why", not "what".
- Use `cn` from `@anlg/utils` for conditional classNames. Always pass an array, split by logical grouping.
- Use `motion/react` instead of `framer-motion`.
- Prefer DOM order for local overlap and portals for cross-tree floating UI. Use `z-index` only inside a bounded stacking context with explicit sibling ordering; do not add arbitrary global or escalating values.

## CLI TUI Command Architecture

Choose the lightest command structure that fits the workflow.

Use the full reducer/effect/runtime split only when the command has async orchestration, a multi-step workflow, or substantial state transitions that benefit from reducer-style tests.

```
commands/<name>/
  mod.rs        -- Screen impl, Args, run()          [glue]
  app.rs        -- App or screen-local state          [optional]
  action.rs     -- Action enum                        [optional]
  effect.rs     -- Effect enum                        [optional]
  runtime.rs    -- Runtime, RuntimeEvent              [async I/O]
  ui.rs         -- draw(frame, app)                   [rendering]
```

Naming rules:

- Types drop the command prefix: `App`, `Action`, `Effect`, `Runtime`, `RuntimeEvent`
- `app.rs` → `app/mod.rs` with private submodules when state is complex
- `ui.rs` → `ui/mod.rs` with sub-files when rendering is complex
- `action.rs`/`effect.rs` are siblings of `mod.rs` when they exist; do not create them by default for simple list/detail screens
- `app.rs` contains no rendering logic, no API calls, no async code when using the reducer pattern
- Prefer `screen.rs` plus a small local state struct for simple browse/select flows
- Do not add parent-level action/effect translation layers that proxy child workflows through another command's reducer

## Misc

- Do not create summary docs or example code files unless requested.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

The cloud image is Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64 with Node, pnpm, Rust, and the Linux libraries needed for Tauri (see `scripts/setup-linux-tauri.sh` and `scripts/setup-linux-others.sh`), plus `xvfb`/`dbus-x11`. Verify installed tool versions against the repository/CI pins above; an existing image may lag a toolchain update. The startup update script installs workspace dependencies and builds `@anlg/ui`; it does not re-install system packages.

- Use `pnpm exec turbo dev:desktop` / `pnpm exec turbo dev:web`: Turbo builds `@anlg/ui` first via `dependsOn`; raw `pnpm dev:*` does not.
- No `start`/`terminals` are configured in the environment (only the `install`/update script). Dev servers are started on demand, not auto-launched on boot.
- A real XFCE desktop runs on the VNC display `:1` (this is what computer-use sees). Run the desktop app there so it is visible: `DISPLAY=:1 LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 GALLIUM_DRIVER=llvmpipe WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 pnpm exec turbo dev:desktop`. The first native build is slow; the desktop Vite frontend serves on `:1422`.
- `dotenvx` loads `.env.supabase`/`.env` with `--ignore MISSING_ENV_FILE`. Desktop local notes and public web pages can run without cloud credentials. Hosted STT/LLM requires an API key configured in settings; local development uses `cargo run -p api`. Provider features also need provider credentials.
- Web dev serves on `:3000`; auth/DB-backed routes require the Supabase stack.
- Swift formatting requires an available `swift format` executable. If missing, check changed non-Swift files and report the exact unchecked Swift paths; verify them on a host with the formatter. Do not treat a formatter startup error as proof that Swift files are formatted, or waive other formatting failures.
- No audio input device exists in the headless pod; use `crates/audio-mock` for automated recording flows. Mobile TypeScript checks run on Linux; Android native builds require Java/Android SDK/NDK setup from `mobile_ci.yaml`. iOS and watchOS builds require macOS/Xcode.
- The default `cc`/`c++` are clang. The native C++ dependencies need a matching `libstdc++` development package (the image provides `libstdc++-14-dev`). The default dev database is `~/.local/share/com.hyprnote.dev/app.db`, with notes in `sessions`/`session_documents`; confirm the running app's channel and configured storage location before inspecting data.
- Changelog, release, and QA skills are exposed to Cursor Cloud via `.cursor/skills/` shims (`new-changelog`, `release-new-version`, `qa-critical-ux`, `qa-cli-mcp-api`). Canonical copies live in `.agents/skills/`; edit those only. `qa-critical-ux` is macOS-native and is not a cloud-environment gate.
